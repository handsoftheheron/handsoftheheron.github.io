            <p class="about-para">Hands of the Heron is an alt-folk project from Bristol, UK. Their instantly recognisable vocal harmonies are delivered by four frontwomen, each of whom brings a signature writing style to the band's mercurial sound. They move effortlessly between sparse choral folk and spellbinding chamber pop, richly layered with violin, saxophone, clarinet, flute, accordion, guitars and banjo. Their second album 13 Moons was released in February 2021 on their own DIY label <a href="https://www.cuculirecords.com/">Cuculi Records</a>, and has been gathering widespread praise from fans and critics alike. <a href="https://cuculirecords.bandcamp.com/album/13-moons">13 Moons</a> is "a wondrous collection of curious story-songs, choral singing and carefully layered instrumentation" (Joyzine) with "songwriting mastery that perfectly delivers reverberating folk-pop" (Tap The Feed). 
            </p>
             <p class="about-para">Having released their debut album As We Lingered in 2017, they embarked on a joint release tour with longtime collaborator Ben Osborn and have since performed at prestigious venues and festivals around the country. Their music has been played on various radio stations, including BBC Introducing & Upload on BBC Bristol, Ujima and 1020 Radio. Their deeply collaborative approach to music creation has evolved gradually since the band’s inception back in 2016, which saw them performing with a more fluid line-up. In 2018, they settled into a consistent five-piece in which everyone contributes to writing and arrangements. This period of collective growth has been captured brilliantly on 13 Moons by producer Alex McIntyre, who has been working alongside them for several years.
